# NotetakingApp
A very simple Java Swing GUI Application for taking notes/memo.

The App utilizes ArrayList and HashMap to keep tracks of the notes, which allows user to search notes based on the topics or keywords in the note contents.

There is no function to save the notes, thus after closing the app all the notes will disappear :(

The search by topic also requires exact match of the topic names, which includes the exact case.
